            <h2>1 Nephi 1:1</h2>
            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of
                my father; and
                having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of
                the Lord in all my
                days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a
                record of my
                proceedings in my days.

                Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
