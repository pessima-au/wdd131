                    <img src="images/albertpessima.jpg" alt="Albert Pessima">
                    <p>My name is Albert Pessima. I was born in Rotifunk, Southern Sierra Leone. I currently live
                        with my
                        family in Freetown, Sierra Leone. I work as a project manager at a construction company. I
                        have a passion for
                        computers, which has led me to study software development. I enjoy spending time at the
                        beach, especially with my
                        family, and also watching a good game of football. I am currently pursuing a degree in
                        software development at BYU-Idaho to expand my knowledge and skills in web technologies. I
                        am particularly interested in building responsive and user-friendly web applications. In my
                        free time, I like reading about new tech trends, learning new programming languages, and
                        collaborating on open-source projects. I value teamwork, continuous learning, and making a
                        positive impact in my community through technology.

                    <p>Sierra Leone is a small country in West African known for its rich natural resources, vibrant
                        culture, and recent
                        history of resilience. The population of Sierra Leone is around 8 million, with Freetown as its
                        capital and largest
                        city. The country is bordered by Guinea to the north and east, Liberia to the southeast, and the
                        Atlantic Ocean to the
                        southwest, giving it beautiful coastlines and tropical weather. Freetown is the capital and
                        largest city of Sierra Leone, located on the Atlantic coast. It is known for its beautiful
