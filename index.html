                <img class="portrait" src="./images/albertpessima.jpg" alt="">
                <p>My name is Albert Pessima, and I was born in Rotifunk, a beautiful town in the Southern Province of
                    Sierra Leone. I
                    currently live in Freetown with my family, where we enjoy a peaceful and fulfilling life together.
                    Professionally, I
                    work as a Project Manager at a construction company, where I oversee project planning, coordination,
                    and successful
                    implementation.

                    Beyond my professional life, I have a strong passion for technology and computers, which inspired me
                    to pursue studies
                    in software development. I am deeply interested in how technology can be used to solve real-world
                    problems and improve
                    lives—particularly in the areas of education and community development.

                    In my leisure time, I love spending quality moments with my family, especially at the beach, where
                    we often relax and
                    enjoy the ocean breeze. I’m also an enthusiastic football fan who appreciates the teamwork,
                    strategy, and excitement
                    that the game brings. </p>

                <p>Sierra Leone is a country located on the west coast of Africa. It is bordered by Guinea to the north
                    and east, Liberia to the southeast,
                    and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and southwest. The capital city of Sierra Leone is Freetown. The
                    country has a diverse culture with
                    over 16 ethnic groups, each with its own unique traditions and customs. Sierra Leone is known for
                    its beautiful beaches,
                    rich history, and vibrant music scene. The country has a tropical climate with a rainy season from
                    May to November and a dry season from December to April.
                    Sierra Leone is also home to a variety of wildlife, including chimpanzees, elephants, and various
                    bird species.</p>
